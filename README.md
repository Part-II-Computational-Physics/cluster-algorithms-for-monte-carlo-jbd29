# Computer Project

jbd29 computational project for part II physics.
Modules are named by what they do.

init_lattice.py constructs the lattice and allows calcualtion of observables used in the report
autocorrelation_functions.py calculates the autocorrelation and autocorrelation time of an observable series
MH_algorithm.py is my implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
Wolff_algorithm.py is my implementation of the Wolff cluster algorithm

All simulation .py files are named for after the figure in the report for which they generate data
